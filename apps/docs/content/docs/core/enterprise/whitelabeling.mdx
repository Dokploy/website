title: Whitelabeling
description: Rebrand Dokploy with your logo, colors, and domain
---


## What you can customize

- **Logo** — Header and login logo.
- **Favicon** — Browser tab icon.
- **Colors** — Primary color and accent (e.g. buttons, links).
- **Custom domain** — Serve the app from your own domain (e.g. `deploy.yourcompany.com`).

## Configuration

Whitelabel settings are managed in the Enterprise admin area (or via environment variables, depending on your deployment).

1. Go to **Settings** → **Whitelabel** (or equivalent in your Enterprise setup).
2. Upload your **logo** (recommended: SVG or PNG, transparent background).
3. Upload your **favicon** (e.g. ICO or PNG).
4. Set **primary color** and **accent color** (hex codes).
5. If using a custom domain, configure your reverse proxy (e.g. Traefik, Nginx) and DNS to point to your Dokploy instance, and set the **base URL** in Dokploy to match.

## Custom domain

1. Create a CNAME (or A) record pointing your domain to the server or load balancer where Dokploy runs.
2. Configure TLS (e.g. Let's Encrypt) on your reverse proxy for that hostname.
3. In Dokploy, set the **Application URL** (or equivalent) to `https://your-domain.com`.
4. Restart or reload Dokploy so it uses the new base URL for redirects and links.

## Best practices

- Use high-resolution logos (e.g. 2x) for sharp display on retina screens.
- Keep primary and accent colors accessible (sufficient contrast for text and buttons).
- Test login and main flows after changing logo and colors to ensure nothing is broken or hard to read.
