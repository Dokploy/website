description: Configure SSO with Auth0
---


## 1. Create an application in Auth0

1. Log in to the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/).
2. Go to **Applications** → **Applications** → **Create Application**.
3. Choose **Regular Web Application** and create it.
4. Note your **Domain**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**.

## 2. Configure Dokploy

1. In Dokploy, go to **Settings** (or **Organization** / **Security** in Enterprise).
2. Enable **SSO** and choose **OpenID Connect**.
3. Enter:
   - **Provider**: myorg-name-auth0 (Unique)
   - **Issuer URL**: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/` (Make sure add the trailing slash)
   - **Domain**: `your-domain.com` (Your domain)
   - **Client ID**: from Auth0 application
   - **Client Secret**: from Auth0 application
   - **Scopes**: openid email profile
4. Save.

## 3. Configure Auth0

1. In your application, go to **Settings**.
2. Set **Allowed Callback URLs** to your Dokploy URL, for example:
   - `https://your-dokploy-domain.com/api/auth/callback/myorg-name-auth0`
3. Set **Allowed Logout URLs** to:
   - `https://your-dokploy-domain.com`
4. Set **Allowed Origins** to:
   - `https://your-dokploy-domain.com`
5. Save changes.

## Troubleshooting

- **Redirect URI mismatch** — Ensure the callback URL in Dokploy matches exactly what is configured in Auth0 (including protocol and path).
- **Invalid client** — Double-check Client ID and Client Secret, and that the application is a web application.
- **Scopes** — Ensure Auth0 is configured to return `openid` and, if required, `email` and `profile`.
