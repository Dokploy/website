title: IPv6 Support
description: "Enable IPv6 networking for Dokploy, including Docker Swarm tweaks and NAT64 for IPv6‑only remote servers."
---

import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

Dokploy runs on top of Docker Swarm, which does **not** enable IPv6 by default.
This guide shows how to

* rebuild the internal `docker_gwbridge` with IPv6,
* tell the Docker daemon which IPv6 blocks it may allocate, and
* add DNS64/NAT64 so IPv6‑only remote machines can still reach IPv4‑only hosts such as GitHub.

## Enable IPv6 in Docker Swarm

<Callout title="Back up compose files/secrets/volumes or snapshot the machine first" type="warn">
  * This guide assumes that there's only a single routed IPv6 to the server.
  * This procedure stops and removes every running container. Anything not stored in a named volume or external backup will be **permanently lost**.
  * All websites and services hosted on this server will be **offline for the entire duration** of the install.
  * The steps below are tested on Debian (Docker version 28.1.1) and will only work on Debian-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu). Behavior on other distros or with older Docker versions may differ.
  * Running a production website over IPv6-only is **not recommended**; many residential and corporate networks still lack IPv6 connectivity. Prefer dual-stack or an IPv4 front-end.
</Callout>

If Dokploy is not already installed, don't install it yet. Instead, install Docker with the following command and then jump straight to step 4:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

1. Stop Dokploy's Traefik proxy:

    ```bash
    docker container stop dokploy-traefik
    ```

    <Callout>
      `dokploy-traefik` binds to port 80 and will prevent the installer from recreating the swarm in step 9.
    </Callout>

2. Leave the existing swarm:

    ```bash
    docker swarm leave --force
    ```

3. Delete the default bridge:

    ```bash
    docker network rm docker_gwbridge
    ```

4. Create an IPv6-capable `docker_gwbridge`:

    ```bash
    docker network create \
      --driver bridge \
      --opt com.docker.network.bridge.name=docker_gwbridge \
      --opt com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_forwarding=true \
      --opt com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade=true \
      --ipv6 \
      --subnet fd00:100::/64 \
      --gateway fd00:100::1 \
      docker_gwbridge
    ```

    <Callout>
      `fd00:100::/64` is a private unique-local block — safe for internal use.
    </Callout>

5. Discover a routed /64 and derive a /56 pool for overlay networks. Copy the output from this command and save it for the next step:

    ```bash
    cidr=$(ip -6 r | awk '/proto kernel/{print $1;exit}'); IFS=':/' read -ra f <<< "$cidr"; printf 'CIDR: %s\nPool: %s:%s:%x::/56\n' "$cidr" "${f[0]}" "${f[1]}" $((0x${f[2]}+1))
    ```

    Example output:

    ```text
    CIDR: 2001:db8:123:1234::/64
    Pool: 2001:db8:124::/56
    ```

6. Edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and add the following entries:

    ```jsonc
    {
      "ipv6": true,
      "fixed-cidr-v6": "2001:db8:123:1234::/64", // <— Replace with the CIDR value from the previous step
      "default-address-pools": [
        {
          "base": "172.16.0.0/12",
          "size": 24
        },
        {
          "base": "2001:db8:124::/56", // <— Replace with the Pool value from the previous step
          "size": 64
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

7. Restart Docker:

    ```bash
    systemctl restart docker
    ```

8. Enable forwarding and accept router advertisements:

    ```bash
    sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra=2
    ```

    <Callout>
      To make this persistent add the keys to `/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf`. If the host uses a static IPv6 address, `accept_ra=1` together with `accept_ra_defrtr=0` may be more appropriate.
    </Callout>

9. Reinstall Dokploy (initialises the swarm and starts Traefik again):

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://dokploy.com/install.sh | sh
    ```

10. Verify IPv6 connectivity:

    ```bash
    docker run --network docker_gwbridge --rm busybox ping -6 -c4 google.com
    ```

    <Callout>
      A successful test returns **0% packet loss**. if `nftables`, `ufw`, or another firewall is running, make sure the new `docker_gwbridge` subnet and UDP 4789 (VXLAN) are allowed.
    </Callout>

## NAT64 for IPv6-only remote servers

Setting up a remote server requires pulling assets from IPv4-only hosts (e.g. raw GitHub files). Add NAT64-aware nameservers so A-records synthesise as AAAA.

1. Open [nat64.net](https://nat64.net/) and copy the DNS64 addresses.
2. On the remote machine edit `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` and add the nameservers so it looks like this:

    ```ini
    DNS=2a00:1098:2b::1 2a00:1098:2c::1 2a01:4f9:c010:3f02::1
    ```

3. Restart the resolver:

    ```bash
    systemctl restart systemd-resolved
    ```

4. Verify that NAT64 is working:

    ```bash
    curl -6 https://httpstat.us/200
    ```

    A plain `200 OK` confirms NAT64 is active.
