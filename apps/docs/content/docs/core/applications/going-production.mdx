By default, dokploy offer multiple [Builds Types](/docs/core/applications/build-type) to deploy your application, the most common is `nixpacks` and `heroku buildpacks`
however this also comes with problems, first is the resources that are required to build your application which some times can lead to timeout on your server or even freezeing your server
and all your application will be down for this reasson, this is mainly problem from `Docker` since the comsumption of resources such as RAM, CPU is very high to build an application.



## Solution

You have two options to solve this problem:

1. Increase the resources of your server CPU, RAM, Disk (Probably is not a good idea and cheapest solution)
2. Build & Publish the application in a CI/CD pipeline eg. Github Actions, Gitlab CI, Gitea Actions, etc. (Recommended)


### Build & Publish the application in a CI/CD pipeline

We will use Github Actions as an example, but you can use any CI/CD pipeline that you want.

We will use the following configuration:

1. **Use Git Provider in Your Application**:
   - Repository: `https://github.com/Dokploy/production-example`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Build path: `/`

<Callout type="info">
The repo have everything you need, however you can follow the same idea for your own applications.

</Callout>


3. The repository already have a Dockerfile, so we will use that, in the case your application is different create your own Dockerfile is required for this guide.
4. We will use `Dockerhub` as an example, but you can use any container registry that you want.
5. Make sure to create the repository in the `Dockerhub` , `namespace` is your username and `repository` is `example`.
6. Create a new Github Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
7. Add the following code to the workflow:

```yaml
name: Build Docker images

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

jobs:
  build-and-push-dockerfile-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }} # Make sure to add the secrets in your repository in -> Settings -> Secrets (Actions) -> New repository secret
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}   # Make sure to add the secrets in your repository in -> Settings -> Secrets (Actions) -> New repository secret

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          context: .
          file: ./Dockerfile
          push: true
          # Make sure to replace with your own namespace and repository
          tags: |
            namespace/example:latest 
          platforms: linux/amd64     
```
8. Create your own Dockerfile, in this case we will use the `Dockerfile` from the repository.

```properties
FROM node:18-alpine AS base
ENV PNPM_HOME="/pnpm"
ENV PATH="$PNPM_HOME:$PATH"
RUN corepack enable

FROM base AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/pnpm/store pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
ENV NODE_ENV=production
RUN pnpm run build

FROM base AS dokploy
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Copy only the necessary files
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/package.json ./package.json
COPY --from=build /app/node_modules ./node_modules

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["pnpm", "start"]
```

9. Now when you make a commit to your repository, the workflow will be triggered and the application will build and push to `Dockerhub`.
10. Now let's create application in Dokploy.
11. In `Source Type` select `Docker`
12. In the docker image field enter `namespace/example:latest`
13. Click on `Save`.
14. Click on `Deploy`.
15. Go to `Domains` and click `Dices` icon to generate a domain and the port set to `3000`.
16. Now you can access your application.

### Auto deploy

When using Dockerhub as a registry you can also enable auto deploy, this will automatically deploy your application whenever you push to your repository.

To setup auto deploys for Dockerhub, follow the steps below:

1. Go to your application and select `Deployments` tab.
2. Copy the `Webhook URL`.
3. Go to your Dockerhub repository and select `Webhooks` tab.
4. Set a name for the webhook and paste the `Webhook URL` copied in step 2.
5. That's it, now every time you push to your repository, your application will trigger a deployment in dokploy.

The deployment will trigger only if the `Tag` matches the one specified in Dokploy.


#### External Registry

If you have a registry that is not Dockerhub, you can trigger a deployment after pushing to your repository in Github Actions.

Your workflow will look like this:

This method use the [Api Method](/docs/core/auto-deploy#api-method) to trigger a deployment.

```yaml
name: Build Docker images

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

jobs:
  build-and-push-dockerfile-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
       ...Same as step 7 from the previous example
          
      - name: Trigger Dokploy Deployment
        uses: dokploy/dokploy-action@v1
        run: |
            curl -X 'POST' \
            'https://<your-dokploy-domain>/api/trpc/application.deploy' \
            -H 'accept: application/json' \
            -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN' \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            -d '{
                "json":{
                    "applicationId": "YOUR-APPLICATION-ID"
                }
            }'
```

You can also use this Github Action [Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dokploy-deployment) to automate the deployment.
