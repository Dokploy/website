Rollbacks are a powerful feature that allows you to easily revert changes to your application. This is particularly useful when you encounter issues or want to revert to a previous version of your application.


## Requirements

1. Have a `/health` endpoint in your application.

## Steps to Rollback


Suppose we have a NodeJS application running on port 3000 with a health check route `/api/health` that returns a 200 status code.

1. In your application is necessary to have a `Path` or `Health Route` to be able to achieve zero downtime deployments eg. in the case of a NodeJS app you can have a route `/api/health` that returns a 200 status code.
2. Go to `Advanced` Tab and go to Cluster Settings and enter to `Swarm Settings`
3. There are a couple options that you can use, in this case we will focus on `Health Check` and `Update Config`.
4. Paste the code below in the `Health Check` field:
    ```json
    {
      "Test": [
        "CMD",
        "curl",
        "-f",
        "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health"
      ],
      "Interval": 30000000000,
      "Timeout": 10000000000,
      "StartPeriod": 30000000000,
      "Retries": 3
    }
    ```
    Note:
    1. Ensure the API Route exists in your application
    2. For Dockerfile deployments, ensure that
        - your host is configured to listen to 127.0.0.1 (or 0.0.0.0). For example, for NextJS Dockerfile, ensure `ENV HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` is set.
        - your docker image has `curl` installed (this is not available by default on alpine-based images). Alternatively, you can use wget:
            ```json
            "Test": [
              "CMD",
              "wget",
              "--spider",
              "-q",
              "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/health"
            ],
            ```

5. Next, in the `Update Config` field, copy and paste this code block:
    ```json
    {
      "Parallelism": 1,
      "Delay": 10000000000,
      "FailureAction": "rollback",
      "Order": "start-first"
    }
    ```

Now when the application is getting unhealthy response from the health check, the container will rollback to the previous version.
