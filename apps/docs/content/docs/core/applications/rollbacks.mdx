Rollbacks are a powerful feature that allows you to easily revert changes to your application. This is particularly useful when you encounter issues or want to revert to a previous version of your application.

## Requirements

1. Have a `/health` endpoint in your application.
2. Configured `Health Check` by following the instructions in the <Link href="./zero-downtime">Zero Downtime Instructions</Link>

## Steps to Rollback

Suppose we have a NodeJS application running on port 3000 with a health check route `/api/health` that returns a 200 status code.

Assuming you have already set up <Link href="./zero-downtime">healthchecks for your application</Link>, you can additionally configure rollback using the steps below:

1. Go to `Advanced` Tab and go to Cluster Settings and enter to `Swarm Settings`
2. Locate the `Update Config` section.
3. Paste the code block below:
    ```json
    {
      "Parallelism": 1,
      "Delay": 10000000000,
      "FailureAction": "rollback",
      "Order": "start-first"
    }
    ```

Now, when the application is unhealthy from the health checks, the container will automatically roll back to a previous available version.
