Dokploy validates different components depending on the type of remote server you're configuring. The validation requirements differ between **Deployment Servers** and **Build Servers**.

## Deployment Servers

For **Deployment Servers**, Dokploy requires the following 7 components to be properly configured:

1. **Docker Installed**: Docker must be installed on the remote server.
2. **RClone Installed**: RClone must be installed on the remote server.
3. **Nixpacks Installed**: Nixpacks must be installed on the remote server.
4. **Railpack Installed**: Railpack must be installed on the remote server.
5. **Buildpacks Installed**: Buildpacks must be installed on the remote server.
6. **Docker Swarm Initialized**: Docker Swarm must be initialized on the remote server.
7. **Dokploy Network Created**: A Docker network for Dokploy must be created on the remote server.
8. **Main Directory Created**: A directory must be created on the remote server to store applications.

<Callout type="info">
  Deployment servers are used to run and host your applications. They require Docker Swarm and network configuration since they need to run containers and manage deployments.
</Callout>

## Build Servers

For **Build Servers**, Dokploy only validates the following components:

1. **Docker Installed**: Docker must be installed on the remote server.
2. **RClone Installed**: RClone must be installed on the remote server.
3. **Nixpacks Installed**: Nixpacks must be installed on the remote server.
4. **Railpack Installed**: Railpack must be installed on the remote server.
5. **Buildpacks Installed**: Buildpacks must be installed on the remote server.
6. **Main Directory Created**: A directory must be created on the remote server to store applications.

<Callout type="info">
  Build servers are dedicated to building and compiling applications. They don't require Docker Swarm or network configuration since they only build images and push them to a registry, without running any containers.
</Callout>

## Validation Status

Once all requirements are met for your server type, you will see a green checkmark next to each item in the validation section.
