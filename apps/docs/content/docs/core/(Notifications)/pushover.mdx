Pushover notifications are a great way to stay up to date with important events in your Dokploy panel. You can choose to receive notifications for specific events or all events.

## Pushover Notifications

To start receiving Pushover notifications, you need to fill the form with the following details:

- **Name**: Enter any name you want.
- **User Key**: Enter your Pushover user key. eg. `ub3de9kl2q...`
- **API Token**: Enter your Pushover application API token. eg. `a3d9k2q7m4...`
- **Priority**: Enter the priority of the notification (-2 to 2, default: 0).
  - `-2`: Lowest priority (no sound/vibration)
  - `-1`: Low priority (no sound/vibration)
  - `0`: Normal priority (default)
  - `1`: High priority (bypasses quiet hours)
  - `2`: Emergency priority (requires acknowledgment)

For emergency priority (2), you must also provide:

- **Retry**: How often (in seconds) Pushover will retry the notification. Minimum 30 seconds.
- **Expire**: How long (in seconds) to keep retrying. Maximum 10800 seconds (3 hours).

To setup the Pushover notifications, you can read the [Pushover Documentation](https://pushover.net/api).
