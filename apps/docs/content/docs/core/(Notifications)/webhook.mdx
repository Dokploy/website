Webhook notifications are a generic way to receive notifications from Dokploy to any HTTP endpoint. You can choose to receive notifications for specific events or all events. Notifications are sent in JSON format.

## Webhook Notifications

To start receiving webhook notifications, you need to fill the form with the following details:

- **Name**: Enter any name you want.
- **Webhook URL**: Enter the webhook URL where you want to receive notifications. eg. `https://your-endpoint.com/webhook`

## Testing Your Webhook

For testing purposes, you can use [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to generate a unique URL and inspect the JSON payload that Dokploy sends:

1. Go to [https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site)
2. Copy your unique webhook URL
3. Go to Dokploy **Notifications** and select **Webhook** as the notification provider
4. Enter a name for your notification configuration
5. Paste the webhook URL you copied
6. Click on **Test** to send a test notification
7. Check your Webhook.site page to see the JSON payload
8. Click on **Create** to save the notification

## JSON Format

Dokploy sends notifications in JSON format. The payload structure includes information about the event type, timestamp, and relevant details about the action that triggered the notification.

**Example notification payload:**

```json
{
  "title": "Test Notification",
  "message": "Hi, From Dokploy 👋",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-07T19:41:53.470Z"
}
```

## Production Setup

For production use, ensure your webhook endpoint:

- Accepts POST requests
- Returns a 2xx HTTP status code for successful delivery
- Handles JSON payloads
- Is accessible from the internet (or from your Dokploy server's network)
- Implements proper authentication if needed (consider using HTTPS with API keys in headers)
