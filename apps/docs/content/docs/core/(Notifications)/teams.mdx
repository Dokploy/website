Microsoft Teams notifications are a great way to stay up to date with important events in your Dokploy panel. You can choose to receive notifications for specific events or all events.

## Microsoft Teams Notifications

To start receiving Teams notifications, you need to fill the form with the following details:

- **Name**: Enter any name you want.
- **Webhook URL**: Enter the incoming webhook URL for your Teams channel (e.g. `https://outlook.office.com/webhook/...` or a URL from the Workflows app).

To set up Microsoft Teams notifications, follow these steps:

1. Open Microsoft Teams and go to the channel where you want to receive notifications.
2. Click the **•••** (More options) next to the channel name and select **Connectors** or **Workflows**.
3. **Option A – Incoming Webhook (Connectors):** Search for **Incoming Webhook**, configure it with a name (e.g. `Dokploy`), and copy the generated **Webhook URL**.
4. **Option B – Workflows app:** Use the “Send webhook alerts to a channel” template, add the workflow to the channel, and copy the generated webhook URL.
5. Go to Dokploy **Notifications** and select **Microsoft Teams** as the notification provider.
6. Paste the **Webhook URL** you copied.
7. Click **Test** to verify the connection, then click **Create** to save the notification.
