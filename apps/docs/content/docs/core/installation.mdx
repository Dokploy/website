### Requirements

To ensure a smooth experience with Dokploy, your server should have at least 2GB of RAM and 30GB of disk space. This specification helps to handle the resources consumed by Docker during builds and prevents system freezes.

  **Suggestion:** For cost efficiency with reliable service, we recommend
  Hetzner as the best value-for-money VPS provider.

### Docker

Dokploy utilizes Docker, so it is essential to have Docker installed on your server. If Docker is not already installed, Dokploy's installation script will install it automatically. Use the following command to install Dokploy:


<div className="flex flex-col gap-10 px-4 bg-green-200 dark:bg-[#031F10] text-green-900 dark:text-green-300 rounded-lg">

</div>

```bash
curl -sSL https://dokploy.com/install.sh | sh
```

## Completing the Setup

After running the installation script, Dokploy and its dependencies will be set up on your server. Here's how to finalize the setup and start using Dokploy:

### Accessing Dokploy

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://your-ip-from-your-vps:3000`. You will be directed to the initial setup page where you can configure the administrative account for Dokploy.

<Callout type='warn'>
    **Important:** Ensure that your server's firewall allows traffic on port
    3000 to access the Dokploy web interface.
</Callout>

### Initial Configuration

1. **Create an Admin Account:** Fill in the necessary details to set up your administrator account. This account will be the admin account for Dokploy.

### Secure Your Installation
After setting up your admin account, it's crucial to secure your Dokploy installation.
The first thing to do is to **enable HTTPS:**
You need to go to **Web Server** > **Server Domain** and add your domain, then enable the **HTTPS** toggle and select the certificate provider you want to use.

<Callout type='warn'>
    If you are using Cloudflare origin certificates, once you have added the certificate, make sure to set the certificate provider to `None` in your domain settings.
</Callout>

### Disable access via ip:port (Optional but Recommended)
To enhance security, it's advisable to restrict access to Dokploy via the server's IP address and port. This can be achieved by running this command on the server:

```bash
docker service update --publish-rm "published=3000,target=3000,mode=host" dokploy
```
To further secure your installation, consider reading the [Security recommendations](/docs/core/multi-server/security#security-recommendations) section.
