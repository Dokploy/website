title: "Vault"
description: "Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log. To sign in: In the Vault UI, select 'Token' as the authentication method (not GitHub), then enter the root token from the VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID environment variable (auto-generated)."
